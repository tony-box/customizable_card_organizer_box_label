If you want to use MTG Set or Mana/Card Symbols:

* Install MTG Set/Keyrune Fonts: https://keyrune.andrewgioia.com/
* Install MTG Mana Symbol Fonts: https://mana.andrewgioia.com/

    ***IMPORTANT*** In Windows, OpenSCAD requires you to install fonts for ALL USERS in order to use them. Ensure you do this! Search google if you need help!

After the font packs are installed for all users, input either "mana" or "keyrune" into the fontL or fontR parameters depending on which font you'd like to use. Then use andrewgioia's cheat sheets (see links below) to copy/paste the desired symbol into the textL or textR parameters.

If everything was installed and configured properly, you should see the set symbols rendered in OpenSCAD!
